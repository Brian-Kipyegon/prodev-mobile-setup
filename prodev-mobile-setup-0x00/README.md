# Observations from `npm run reset-project`

Running the `reset-project` command in the Expo project resulted in the following:

- ðŸ§¹ **Cleared Metro Bundler cache**  
  This helps prevent unexpected behavior caused by stale cached code.

- ðŸ§± **Removed `node_modules`**  
  Ensured that all installed packages are cleared, making room for a fresh install.

- ðŸ“¦ **Reinstalled project dependencies**  
  The project re-downloaded all required packages listed in `package.json`.

- ðŸ”§ **Resolved potential environment issues**  
  This process helped fix issues that might arise due to outdated or corrupted dependencies.

- ðŸš€ **Successfully restarted the app**  
  After the reset, running `npx expo start` worked without errors, confirming the app environment was clean and consistent.

This command is useful for troubleshooting and ensuring the Expo environment is in a predictable state.
